# Introduction

This is an example vignette for the `myPackage` package, an example package created as part of my tutorial on making R packages. This practice package contains a couple of functions. One of them, `random_movie_recommendation`, utilizes the `ggplot2movies` package from CRAN, which provides a dataset of movies. The other function, `calculate_group_mean`, uses example data included in `myPackage`.

## Example Data

The `example_data` dataset included in this package contains a small sample of data for demonstration purposes. It has three columns: `ID`, `Age`, and `Likes_Coffee`. Here is how you can load and view the dataset:

```{r}
# Load the example dataset
data(example_data, package = "myPackage")

# View the dataset
example_data
```

\

# Random Movie Recommendation

The `random_movie_recommendation` function randomly selects and returns the title of a movie from the `ggplot2movies` dataset. This function is useful for getting a random movie suggestion.

Here is how you can use the `random_movie_recommendation` function:

```{r}
random_movie_recommendation()
```

\

# Calculate Group Mean

The `calculate_group_mean` function calculates the mean of a numeric variable for rows where a specified binary variable is TRUE. In our example dataset, it can be used to find the mean age of people who like coffee.

Here is how you can use the `calculate_group_mean` function:

```{r}
calculate_group_mean(example_data, "Age", "Likes_Coffee")
```
